# Required Configuration Settings

# The URL to the OctoPrint server.
# Example: http://octopi.local or http://localhost:5000.
# Note: the protocol (http:// or https://) is required.
# If the setting for OCTOPRINT_HOST does not contain the protocol,
# an error will be displayed when OctoScreen starts.
OCTOPRINT_HOST=http://localhost:5000


# OctoScreen expects an API key to be supplied. The API key can
# either be set in OctoScreen's config file, or in OctoPrint's config
# file (OCTOPRINT_CONFIG_FILE below)
OCTOPRINT_APIKEY=


# Location of the application theme
OCTOSCREEN_STYLE_PATH=/opt/octoscreen/styles/z-bolt/



# Optional Configuration Settings

# The location of OctoPrint's config.yaml file.
# If empty, the file path used will be the pi home folder of the current user.

# config file.

# The file path to where the log file will be saved.
# The file path should be a fully qualified path and not only include the path
# to the log file, but the name of the log file as well
# (eg /home/pi/logs/logfile.txt).
# The log file is appended to and is never automatically truncated, and
# will grow over time.  If you turn log file logging on (by specifying a path),
# be sure to turn it off (by setting the value to "").
OCTOSCREEN_LOG_FILE_PATH=
#OCTOSCREEN_LOG_FILE_PATH=/home/pi/logs/logfile.txt
